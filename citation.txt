WHAT IS WORKING: My downloader, my threads, my gdown library, and my file outputs, everything!
WHAT IS NOT WORKING: Nothing. I have full functionality, I guess you can't download outside google drive though.

I used a few different sources for this project. First I will go over non-AI stuff.

https://pypi.org/project/gdown/
Gdown! This is the main piece of my project. I like google, and I enjoy working with chromium stuff, so I figured
google drive was the easiest way to get my files hosted tow download from.
I used the documentation to look through the methods for this library, and it was interesting.
The main thing I needed was gdown.download, and its really simple, yippee gdown!

I used a lot of our previous work, mainly my parallel python stuff with threads from before as templates.


AI STUFF:

I used a decent amount of GPT prompts, most of which didn't work because its stupid.

Here's the prompts and what I used:

Write me a basic python file template with hello world:
def main():
    print("Hello, world!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
(I used the whole thing)

Write me an example function to download a single google drive folder from a link with gdown:
import gdown

def download_drive_folder(folder_url, output_dir="downloads"):
    """
    Downloads a Google Drive folder given a full folder URL.

    Args:
        folder_url (str): The full Google Drive folder URL.
        output_dir (str): The local directory to save the folder contents.
    """
    if "drive.google.com" not in folder_url or "/folders/" not in folder_url:
        raise ValueError("Invalid Google Drive folder URL.")

    # Extract folder ID from the URL
    folder_id = folder_url.split("/folders/")[1].split("?")[0]

    print(f"Downloading folder to: {output_dir}")
    gdown.download_folder(id=folder_id, output=output_dir, quiet=False, use_cookies=False)
    print("Download complete.")
(I used most of this but retrofitted it for my setup)

MY THOUGHTS ON AI USE IN THIS PROJECT:
I found it helpful. I didn;t have to really learn the library as much as I got chatGPT
to write the one functionality I needed syntax for, and didn't have to look at anything else.
I think this is a situation where AI can be a superpower. I am a good programmer, captain america strong. Not flying around
but still pretty strong. GPT here made me fly, laser vision, superman. Very helpful, but you have to be captain america first.
